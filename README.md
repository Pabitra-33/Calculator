# Calculator
Creating a simple calculator using Java AWT and Swing involves creating a graphical user interface (GUI) with number buttons, operator buttons, a text field to display input and 
result, and clear and equals buttons. The calculator can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

Functionalities:
Addition: Allows users to add two numbers together.
Subtraction: Allows users to subtract one number from another.
Multiplication: Allows users to multiply two numbers.
Division: Allows users to divide one number by another.
Clear: Clears the display and resets the calculator.
Equals: Computes the result of the operation entered by the user.
